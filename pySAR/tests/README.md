* `/test_aaindex` - stores all required test data and datasets used to test pySAR's functionality.
* `/test_aaindex` - stores all required test data and datasets used to test pySAR's functionality.
* `/test_aaindex` - stores all required test data and datasets used to test pySAR's functionality.
* `/test_aaindex` - stores all required test data and datasets used to test pySAR's functionality.

To run all unittests, make sure you are in the pySAR directory and from a terminal/cmd-line run:
```python
python -m unittest discover tests -v
```

To run a module's specific unittests, make sure you are in the pySAR directory and from a terminal/cmd-line run:
